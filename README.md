# chazelle-triangulation
Implementation of Bernard Chazelle's algorithm to Triangulate Polygon in Linear Time

Input polygon files are lists of ordered pairs, for example a square:

> -5, -5

> -5, 5

> 5, 5

> 5, -5

Output files have the keyword "diagonals" followed by an ordered list of indices after them:
> diagonals
> 0, 2
